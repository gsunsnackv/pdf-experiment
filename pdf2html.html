<p>My Top Needs

What&rsquo;s Important to You?
Everyone, no matter who you are, has particular needs that will cause us to perform well at work. When our work situation meets our
individual needs, we enjoy our work more, perform better, and are more committed to the organization.

In this exercise, you&rsquo;ll review the areas below and select three areas that are really important to you. These areas should be the things you
must have to create a job that you really enjoy doing and want to perform well in.

Instructions
1. Read the nine areas below. Think about what you need at work to do a great job. Although all the areas would be great to have,
</p>
<p>determine which three areas are most important to you. Check the three areas.

2. Soon you&rsquo;ll meet with your manager to discuss your three most important needs. Be prepared to share which areas you selected and
</p>
<p>why they are important. Your manager will then share how these needs can be met by your job and by the organization.


Select the three areas you need to be successful in your job.
</p>
<p>!  Flexibility
I need a flexible work environment.
This includes flexibility in how I get my
work done, as well as flexibility in my
work schedule.
</p>
<p>!  Coaching
I need coaching to help build the skills
and capabilities I need now and in the
future. This includes work priorities,
feedback and direction setting.
</p>
<p>!  Teamwork
I need great teamwork. I want to be
part of a team whose co-workers pull
together, support one another, and
enjoy working together.
</p>
<p>!  Challenging Work
I need work that is challenging. I want
work that pushes me to be innovative
and creative, as well as stretches my
skills and capabilities.
</p>
<p>!  Career Opportunities
I need opportunities to grow within the
organization. I want to have roles in
the future that expand my skills and
the type of work I do, as well as
increase my responsibilities.
</p>
<p>!  Feedback
I need feedback on my performance. I
want to know what I&rsquo;m doing well, and
what I need to do differently to be a
high performer.
</p>
<p>!  Manager Support
I need a manager who supports me.
This includes backing me up and
standing by me in difficult situations,
as well as believing in me and what I
can do.
</p>
<p>!  Development
I need to develop my skills and
capabilities. I want various
opportunities to grow and strengthen
my abilities for my current job, as well
as future roles within the organization.
</p>
<p>!  Work Life Balance
I need to have a balance between my
work and my personal life. I want to
work hard and contribute, but it would
be hard to feel like I was living at work
and compromising my personal
responsibilities.
